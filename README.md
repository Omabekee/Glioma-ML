# Glioma-ML
This project involves the identification of key biomarkers associated with IDH status in low-grade glioblastoma (llg) samples, using differential gene expression analysis (DGE) and machine learning (Random forest and K-nearest neighbors).

The analysis was performed by the OncoHackers team using a range of R libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, DGE analysis and ML classification.
